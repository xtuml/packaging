UI for ANTLR 2.7.6

Features:
  - editor which is aware of ANTLR grammar (syntax highlighting)
  - outline page which shows sections of ANTLR grammar files (content of a
    modified grammar file editor is parsed every second and the according
    outline is updated with the resulting grammar file model)
  - JSR-45 grammar-level debugging for ANTLR grammars
  - action in navigator context menu to compile ANTLR grammar files manually
  - action in navigator context menu to add/remove ANTLR project nature
    to/from the currently selected project
  - editor context menu 'Goto Rule' to navigate to rule under cursor
  - annotation hover for errors
  - text annotations for rules (first 10  lines of the rule's source code)
  - commenting and uncommenting (Ctrl+/ and Ctrl+\)
  - content assist for rules (Ctrl+Space)
  - leverage customizable keybinding facility of Eclipse 2.1
  - preferences page for editor's syntax highliting
  - Resource label decoration of ANTLR generated files with name of according
    grammar file
  - property page for grammar files which allows to specification of all
    command-line options

Requirements:
  - Eclipse 3.0 or 3.1
  - ANTLR plugin 'org.antlr_2.7.6'
  - ANTLR core plugin 'org.antlr.core_4.1.0'

How-to use:
  - disable Eclipse's Java compiler from copying ANTLR grammar file to the
    output directory by adding '*.g' to the filtered resources in the
    preferences (Window/Preferences/Java/Compiler/Other)
  - to use the automatic builder for ANTLR grammar files you have to add the
    ANTLR nature to the according project first (context menu 'Toggle ANTLR
    project nature'

Todo:
  - save grammar file if IObjectActionDelegate 'Compile Grammar' is invoked
  - add wizard to add/remove 'antlrnature' (with ANTLR's
    IncrementalProjectBuilder) to/from a project
  - create ANTLR specific icon for grammar file object
